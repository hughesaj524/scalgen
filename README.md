# scalgen
Some simple-ish first steps into scala genetic algorithms.

I'm entirely new to GitHub, Scala, and GAs, so please tell me anything I'm doing wrong!
I'm still getting into the habit of using Scaladoc as well, so please let me know if I'm doing that wrong.

Also it seems like a shame to waste this name on such an awful beginner project, so let me know if you want it, and I'll make it way wordier and awful!
